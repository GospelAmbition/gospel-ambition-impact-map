adjust hours (24 instead of 100)?
--- Waha’s Mapbox visual?
--- https://dashboard.waha.app/?time=allTime&insights=countryInfo_uniqueCountriesAndLanguages
--- giving options
--- waiting to publish some of our terrible stats
--- change “Onscreen vs Total” to “X of Y global”? 
--- showing intercessor locations vs. places prayed for?
integrating giving into this


From AdHoc review: - change it to “Activity Map”
--- change “Activities” to “New Activities”
go for 1 month if it’s not too weighty 
mobile that has a globe + activity feed
make an “Impact Map” that shows more of the ongoing, progressive impact of what we’re doing
---- change “Onscreen vs Total” to “X of Y global”? 
look for way to not double count intercessors based on when they are signing up and when they pray

conclusion: Complicated 

KK - I’m a little skeptical still about the same #s and dots representing both the intercessors and the places being interceded for.. AH and I lean toward showing intercessor locations 

Should the countries and languages update in the top left map legend area?
